1: `The first time I saw you was back in 8th grade your cute face with those specs 
uff 😭🤍 it honestly caught me off guard and I couldn’t stop noticing you after that. 
Back then Aarya liked you and it felt like you liked them too and that hurt more than 
I wanted to admit 💔 because of that I acted rude towards you even though deep down
it was breaking me from inside. Still my love for you won in the end and slowly 
I started softening towards you 🌱✨ I let my guard down and allowed myself to 
feel everything properly. Then came that one fateful day when I finally talked 
to you and we exchanged numbers and uff I swear I was so so happy that day 😭💖 
my heart felt light like nothing could go wrong. From that moment we started
talking for hours and hours together losing track of time completely 🫶⏳ 
laughing sharing random things and just being us. We were immature back then
messing around and doing silly things but we learned and grew from it 🌻 life
pulled us apart at times and things weren’t always easy but somehow we still
found our way back to each other 🤍✨ and at the end of it all we stayed together 
and honestly that’s all that matters to me 💫`,
2: `Uff on the evening of 5th Jan is when I finally stopped fooling around and asked you
to be my girl 😭❤️ I remember that moment so clearly my hands were shaking and my heart
was beating so fast like it knew this was something real. I was so damn melted when 
the dream girl of my life accepted me 🫠✨ it felt unreal like time just paused for 
a second and everything made sense. After that damn we couldn’t stop talking at all 🫶⏳
hours turned into hours and nights felt too short. We shared little secrets things we 
had never told anyone before 🤍🤫 fears dreams random thoughts silly memories 
everything just flowed so naturally. With you I felt safe calm understood and 
truly myself 🌙💖 we found comfort in each other without even trying and that 
feeling is priceless. At the end of the day that’s all that matters to me and 
always will. I love you so much my princess 👑💕`,
3: `First and foremost, I love you so so much my baby girl 🤍 truly, deeply, in a way that
comes from the quietest and strongest parts of my heart. You broke me in ways I didn’t
even know I could break, but you also helped me rebuild myself into someone stronger,
calmer, and more real than I’ve ever been. I promise you with everything I have that
I’ll never leave you and that I’ll always choose growth, honesty, and effort for us.
I want to become a better person every single day, not just for you, but because
loving you has shown me who I can be. I love you till the very core of my heart,
my pumpkin pie 🧡 with every thought, every breath, every small piece of me.
We’ve learned so much together, we’ve grown through mistakes and misunderstandings,
and we’ve come out stronger and wiser 🌱. I hope we always stay like this, 
choosing kindness, patience, and love, holding each other close even when things 
feel heavy, and standing side by side no matter how hard the days get.
Always caring, always trying, always us 🤍✨`
